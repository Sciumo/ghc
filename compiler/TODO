I use "IA0" as a keyword for grep.

## For the renamer

* implicit kind polymorphism

* Move error messages about Template Haskell in Renamer.

* Add a boolean in TyVar and TcTyVar to know if it's a kind variable or not
  and add a commentary about why it is ok to mix type and kind variables.


## For the type checker

* Add PromotedTyCon TyCon in TyCon to know how to pretty-print a TyConAppTy.

* Sort check HsKind.

* I will definitely need some kind of TcTyFamily TcKindedVar and so on.


## Bugs

* ''a' -> ITtyvar a'
  instead of ITsimplequote 'a'

* Promoted primitive negative integers are not parsed.
  > f :: -1

* What about lifting operators?

* Maybe want to merge UserTyVar and KindedTyVar

* Operators are not printed correctly. See bug/Operators.hs.

* Kinds are not always printed correctly.
  (*, *) instead of '(*, *)
  [*] instead of '[*]
  We might add a Promoted flag in HsTupleTy and HsListTy.

* Types are not always printed correctly.
  21 instead of '21
  "aoeu" instead of '"aoeu"
  We might add a Promoted flag in HsTupleTy and HsListTy.

* No wildpat in types.

  1. How to check conflicts in the parser

% cd compiler/parser
% gcc -E -undef -traditional -P -Iincludes -x c Parser.y.pp | grep -v '^#pragma GCC' >! Parser.y && happy -agc --strict Parser.y -i
